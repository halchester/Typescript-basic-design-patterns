## About this repo

This is for those who are trying to get started with typescipt. It is a simple sorting algorithm(bubble sort). If typescipt files confuses you, then you should check out the python implementation of bubble sort if you're coming from python background. In this repo, I implmented the algorithm for arrays of numbers, string and linear linked list mainly focusing on design patterns. You can ignore the build folder.

### Design Patterns on classes in Typescript and getting started

This is actually a good practice for typescript classes, interfaces and inheritance. To get started clone this repo and `yarn install`. After that you can start the sorting process with `yarn start`. 

#### About interface

Interfaces in Typescript basically means indicating types for Javascript. So how would one use interface? 
- When you want to set up contract between different classes
- When we have very different objects that we want to work together
- When we want to promotes loose coupling

#### Inheritance and classes

On Inheritance and abstract. Abstract classes are used when we want to make one class as a parent and have connections to its children with methods and properties. One of the best things that abstract class does is
- sets up a contract between different classes
- strongly couples classes together
